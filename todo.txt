Temp file to store TODO's before I make a README.md

TODO: Maybe make canvas bigger than target so there can be pasting that goes over the boundary
TODO: Implement other (better) image comparison functions
TODO: Let the canvas start with an image (will make animating easier if you go that route later)
TODO: Add opencv for live monitoring
TODO: Add multiple sample sizes
TODO: Document Everything
TODO: Post on github with pictures, then share with friends :)
